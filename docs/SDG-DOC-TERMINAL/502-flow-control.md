> Flow Control

Bash conditionals and loops for SDG-OS scripting.

### if/then/elif/fi

if [ condition ]; then
    # do something
elif [ other_condition ]; then
    # do something else
else
    # fallback
fi

note: spaces around [ and ] are required.

### Test Operators

File tests:
-f <file>: true if file exists and is a regular file
-d <dir>: true if directory exists
-e <path>: true if path exists
-s <file>: true if file exists and is non-empty
-r/-w/-x <file>: true if file is readable/writable/executable

String tests:
[ "$a" = "$b" ]: string equality (use =, not ==)
[ "$a" != "$b" ]: string inequality
[ -z "$a" ]: true if string is empty
[ -n "$a" ]: true if string is non-empty

Numeric tests:
[ "$a" -eq "$b" ]: equal
[ "$a" -ne "$b" ]: not equal
[ "$a" -gt "$b" ]: greater than
[ "$a" -lt "$b" ]: less than

### Combining Conditions

[ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]: AND
[ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]: OR
[ ! condition ]: NOT

### For Loops

iterate over a list:

for item in one two three; do
    echo "$item"
done

iterate over files:

for file in ~/projects/*; do
    echo "found: $file"
done

iterate over numbers:

for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "number $i"
done

### While Loops

read a file line by line:

while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "line: $line"
done < ~/somefile.txt

infinite loop with break:

while true; do
    read -p "enter q to quit: " input
    [ "$input" = "q" ] && break
done

### Case Statements

case "$var" in
    start)
        echo "starting..."
        ;;
    stop)
        echo "stopping..."
        ;;
    restart|reload)
        echo "restarting..."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "unknown command"
        ;;
esac

### Practical SDG-OS Examples

Checking if a file exists (common in SDG-OS scripts):

#!/bin/bash
STATE=~/.config/sdgos/wallpaper.state
if [ -f "$STATE" ]; then
    CURRENT=$(cat "$STATE")
else
    CURRENT="default"
fi
echo "Current wallpaper group: $CURRENT"

Looping through state files:

for state in ~/.config/sdgos/state/*.state; do
    [ -f "$state" ] || continue
    name=$(basename "$state" .state)
    echo "State for $name: $(cat "$state")"
done
